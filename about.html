        <h2>Our Founders</h2>
        <p>The journey of Studio Ghibli began with the vision and collaboration of three pioneering individuals: Hayao Miyazaki, Isao Takahata, and Toshio Suzuki. Their shared passion for storytelling and animation led to the establishment of the studio in 1985, setting the stage for a new era in animated filmmaking.</p>
